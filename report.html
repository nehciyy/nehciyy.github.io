  <div class="questions">
    <h3>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure
      did you choose to implement.</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    Accompanied by its distinguishable logo, the name of my website is "makeup YM", short for "makeup Your Mind". This website features a plethora of makeup products, and the purpose of this website is that I am aspirating to become a makeup artist.
    As such, I would like to have all the makeup products compiled in a website so it will be easier for me to have a broader view of these products. Apart from the meaning behind the logo, the colour scheme of my website is also a huge highlight.
    This colour is known as the colour of 2022, "Very Peri". This colour is described as a "dynamic periwrinkle blue hue with vivifying violet red undertone, which blends the faithfulness and constancy of blue with the energy and excitement of red".
    "Very Peri" influences across the world from various quarters ranging from entertainment industry to fashion, films in production, traveling art collections, new artists, home furnishings, big sporting events as well as different areas of designs.
    Since my website is about makeup, under the fashion industry as well, I have chosen a colour similar to "Very Peri" to be the main colour of my website alongside with matching pale colours from the similar colour scheme as "Very
    Peri".
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    Moreover, the main layout of this website adapts the hierarchy model structure, which gives users a
    superior user experience as it firstly provides a broad set of information through the parent page, and branches out into further detailed information through the child pages. Furthermore, this hierarchy structure allows smoother user experience,
    easier navigation and overall a more organized page. This attracts users and thus engenders users to spend more time on this website and explore more about the different details of different makeup products. This website is also programmed with
    JavaScript, which allows users to have more interaction with the website itself through means such as commenting and rating the products.
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
      guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    To start off, I chose this topic about makeup because I realised that there are but only a small handful of websites that provide a platform for users to give feedback on certain makeup products and be able to learn the skills of putting on
    makeup.
    This website will most certainly also cater to the younger girls who just started their way with and discovered the world of makeup. There is a whole compilation of YouTube videos provided on the tutorial page for them to understand more about
    the skills of putting on makeup.
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    Moreover, it is statistically proven that women frequently encounter many difficulties deciding on a particular makeup product given the wide variety of products offered in the industry. Hence, this website will allow them to have a better
    understanding of the different functionalities of the products.
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    Lastly, many of the features were taken from the website, Sephora. It includes the newest makeup products and the current trending products alongside with filters so users are able to filter and find the products with greater ease.
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    Firstly, I decided that my font-family should be of sans-serif, and it shall be a dark colour. This choice of a dark font against a light coloured background provides a succinct contrast so that it is easier for the installed Artificial
    Intelligence screen readers to read out the content of my website for the visually impaired people. Furthermore, it improves the accessibility and readability as well.
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    Secondly, I have labelled all images with alt text so that it also to caters well to visually impaired individuals when visiting my website. It describes what is in the image which will help a person with a visual impairment to visualise the
    website and interpret it in their own way, which consequently allows them to be more engaged.
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    At last, I have made my website responsive, such that it caters to different screen sizes such as mobile and desktop mode with the use of @media queries in CSS. Supplementary to a responsive website, in the mobile version, I also included a
    hamburger icon which consists of the collapsed version of a navigation bar. Users on mobile version will subsequently then be able to access the navigation bar at the top right hand corner easily.
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    Usability of a website consists of availability and accessibility where the website is mobile responsive. Hence, I have included @media queries to ensure that my website caters to all mobile versions ranging from Apple IPhones to Samsung phones.
    In addition, users are also able to complete their intended activities immediately and more effectively with the clear navigation bar headers given so that they will know what exactly they need. Following up, they then can head over to the
    particular page and complete their intended activities.
  </p>
  <p class="answers">
    In addition, clarity is another major implication of usability. Thus, I have made clarity a key component of the website by being straightforward and clearly stating that my topic of interest is about makeup products. In addition, it also has
    features that are familiar for users such as the filter button where users are able to click and filter the items out. Apart from the filter buttons, the commenting function on the blog page is also similar to what users are familiar to as it does
    not include any other special features that makes it challenging to understand.
  </p>
  <p class="answers">
    To conclude, I have also made it such that the logo can be clicked. This is so that it will prompt the program to return to the home page for users to "reset" their page so they can navigate from there again. This feature is also ubiquitous
    amongst
    many websites on servers.
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
      how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any
      changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). </h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    I had to find out how to verify and validate an email address when users subscribe to my newsletter website. As such, this led me to research about email validation on how others verify whether the email address is valid. This allowed me to come
    across the email validation code, where I have to implement it in the JavaScript file which will pass through an if statement. If the email is deemed to be valid, the subscription will be successful.
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    To boot, I had to research on how to make an image carousel and I actually happened to come across w3schools which subsequently led me to an extension. However, when I referenced most of my codes from w3schools for the image carousel, it turned
    out that I had certain codes that clash with my carousel codes. As a result, It took a few attempts to finally get the final outcome.
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    Subsequently, the filter buttons for new arrivals and trending page alongside the handlebar for the commenting in the blog page were also difficult for me to handle due to the limited existing knowledge I have, hence I went on to research on
    different websites and sources on how filter buttons are created. After a rather painstaking research process, I fortunately came across a thread on stackoverflow and it shed light on the current methods used. While on the other hand, I managed
    use trial and error finding the way to correctly use handlebar for the comments on the blog page .
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    I personally like the animation of my products when I hover my curser over the items on the new arrivals and trending page. Moreover, the filter button also has :focus CSS styling so that when the particular button is clicked, it will then be
    highlighted with another colour. Whilst on the topic of colour, I also like the colour combination of the website as a whole as it is applied using a specific colour scheme, creating a calming theme to my website. Every page also includes
    interactive components using JavaScript which enhances user experience. The main page (index.html) includes the hover over text, when any image is being hovered over, the text will pop up which creates a slight element of surprise. This in
    my opinion helps to further boost the user experience.
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
      another time?</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    Under my new arrivals page, it includes the price of each item. However, due to the limitations of my knowledge, I am unable to create a backend interface where users will be able to add items to cart and be able to checkout. Since I have
    included prices for my items, I plan to collaborate with companies like Sephora so that my users will be able to make transactions through my webpage. Moreover, if I had the resources and the required database knowledge, I envision my webpage to
    be able to automatically update it's trending makeup products and the new arrivals by itself with the help of database. Another feature that I would like to add would be to the star rating where the system (database) will be able to collate data
    of different user inputs and calculate an average score for each products and reflect a one decimal rating such as 3.5, 4.8, etc.
  </p>

  <div class="questions">
    <h3>What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of
      information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should
      also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="answers">
    JavaScript libraries I used include handlebars.js (for comments on blog page and replacing the entire tutorial page with handlebar), awesomeNotifications (for alerting users when they did not input their values properly), sweetalert (also to
    notify users when they are successfully subscribed to the newsletter), and last but not least rater-js (for the stars rating on blog page).
  </p>

  <p class="answers">
    On the other hand for CSS libraries, I used some bootstrap features (navigation bar buttons) to create my website. Apart from bootstrap, google fonts were also used, where I embedded the chosen google font links into my HTML template so the fonts
    will load when HTML is loaded. Hence, I did not include more fonts for my "font-family" under all stylesheets, after considering that all will load by default. Fontawesome was used to include the social media icons that I have in my footer while
    w3schools stylesheet was used for my image carousel. The rest of the references are stated in the Appendices section below under Appendix C - Acknowledgments.
